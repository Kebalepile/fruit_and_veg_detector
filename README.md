# Fruit and Vegetable Detector

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and it can predict the type of fruit or vegetable from an image or a live video stream.

## Repository Structure


- `data/`: Contains the dataset organized into `train`, `validation`, and `test` directories. Each of these directories contains subdirectories for each class (e.g., apple, banana, carrot).
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for training the model.
- `models/`: Contains the saved model files.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for predicting from images and video streams.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


This `README.md` file provides a comprehensive overview of your project, including its structure, setup instructions, and usage examples for image and video predictions. Feel free to customize it further to fit your project's specifics.
